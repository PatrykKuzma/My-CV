                    QA engineer</h1>
                <div>My name is Patryk J. Kuźma but my friends call me "Jack of all trades".
                    I am a person who thrives while working as a QA Engineer.
                    I am experienced in HTML + CSS, JS, SQL and manual testing.
                    Completion of a medation course gave me skills to solve conflicts in a
                    team environment and my interests in sociology and philosophy give me
                    drive to work in a group. I learned how to manage both my time and
                    resources efficiently I will be more than happy to use this experience in
                    my future work. What I expect in my work environment is a possibility
                    to grow further as a QA engineer, both manual and automation.

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <h3>Preparatory service in the army</h3>
        <div>Nothing teaches discipline and order like the military. Every day was planned in advance
            and there was no room for mistakes. Every moment was shared with the rank and file
            brothers. The army is not only a test of physical fitness but also of willpower, because
            when most days are similar and freedom is limited, not everyone can stand it. I am proud
            to say "I was in the army" even if only for a short time</div>
        <h3>The longest bicycle route</h3>
        <div>What matters in life is not the goal but the path taken to get there. At this point, my
            longest one was a little over 140 km. That day I rode my bike all alone and ended up by
            the sea. It was a wonderful feeling to prove to myself that fortitude and persistence can
            take you really far.
            </div>
        <h3>Perform on stage</h3>
        <div>I had the opportunity to take part in an amateur version of stand up. It was the first time I
            infected more than a few friends with my sense of humor. I remember very fondly the
            standing ovation I received</div>
