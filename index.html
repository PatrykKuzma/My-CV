                    Q A e n g i n e e r</h1>
                <div>I have skills and experience in various fields. I am currently opening myself to the secrets of
                    working as a QA. I can stay calm, I am creative and I have a wide range of knowledge in various
                    aspects, which allows for better social communication. This translates into effectiveness in
                    professional and private life. I managed to learn a lot in previous positions and I will be happy
                    to use this experience in my future work. I am aware that I have a lot to learn and I am counting on
                    this opportunity.

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <h3>Completion of the Mate Academy course </h3>
        <div>The Mate Academy course on software tester work was very intensive. However, it
            largely simulated actual work in the profession, which was a nice change for a person who
            was previously primarily a manual worker. Completing the course made me feel that I had
            actually achieved something more in life and opened the way for further development.
            </div>
        <h3>Preparatory service in the army</h3>
        <div>Nothing teaches discipline and order like the military. Every day was planned in advance
            and there was no room for mistakes. Every moment was shared with the rank and file
            brothers. The army is not only a test of physical fitness but also of willpower, because
            when most days are similar and freedom is limited, not everyone can stand it. I am proud
            to say "I was in the army" even if only for a short time</div>
        <h3>The longest bicycle route</h3>
        <div>What matters in life is not the goal but the path taken to get there. At this point, my
            longest one was a little over 140 km. That day I rode my bike all alone and ended up by
            the sea. It was a wonderful feeling to prove to myself that fortitude and persistence can
            take you really far.
            </div>
        <h3>Perform on stage</h3>
        <div>I had the opportunity to take part in an amateur version of stand up. It was the first time I
            infected more than a few friends with my sense of humor. I remember very fondly the
            standing ovation I received</div>
        <h3>Writing a lot of poems</h3>
        <div>I can boast of a large number of published poems written by me. In my free time, I work
            on a novel in order to set the bar higher. Links to my additional work can be found under contacts.
